"experiment.py" is used to interact with our tool. It runs all the experiments, more details are in "instructions.pdf".

"boxprop_optimized.py" contains the code for the PROLIP box analysis instructions.

"lipprop.py" is a helper class that is called by "boxprop_optimized.py", and it contains code for the PROLIP Lipschitz analysis instructions.

"mnist" loads the generator and classifier networks for the mnist experiment and performs the PROLIP algorithm those networks.

"small_cifar" loads the generator and classifier networks for the small_cifar experiment and performs the PROLIP algorithm those networks.

"large_cifar" loads the generator and classifier networks for the large_cifar experiment and performs the PROLIP algorithm those networks.

"pretrained_classifiers" contains the trained parameter weights for the classifier networks from the experiments.

"pretrained_generators" contains the trained parameter weights for the generator networks from the experiments.

"precomputed_results" contains all of the .png and .csv files generated from the experiments recorded in the paper.

"__pycache__" contains files generated by the Numba library for python code optimization.
